This submission includes 3 items - 
1. A jupyter notebook that describes the model training process, and an evaluation of its performance. Comments in markdown cells explain the training process, and cosiderations I took along it.
2. A jupyter notebook of an evaluation script - that can be used for further usage of the model on unseen test data. One should change the paths for the unseen embedding data, and for the trained model to use it.
3. The trained model.
